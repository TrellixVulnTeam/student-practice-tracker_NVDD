# Detailed Project Plan Sprint 2

- Client-side development must loosely resemble initial mock ups created in previous sprint (client side will be created utilizing Vue.js instead of angular 2)

- A working database instance modeled after our concept's ER mapping hosted on the cloud

- Aplication must be able to add and remove entries from the database

When the above requirements are completed the overall project will have reached 50% completion

- Detailed project plan for sprint 3 must be created
