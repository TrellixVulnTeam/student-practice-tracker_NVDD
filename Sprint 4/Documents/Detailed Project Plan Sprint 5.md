# Detailed Project Plan Sprint 5

## - Client-side development must continue to be shaped such that it is as intuitive as possible.

## - Data validation is to be done. Namely, for when updating entries: no field would be able to be left in blank.

## - Detailed project plan for sprint 4 must be created

## - (Expected but not required for projec overall) Improved query update such that any single field can be updated if ID is known.

## - Plan stayed the same as for Sprint 4 since Sprint 4 was instead use to debug a Bootstrap dependencies problem for better styling
